🏎️ How to Run

    (If double-click doesn't work, you can still run manually with java -jar tictactoe.jar.)

    
🧠 How it Works

  Play against a smart AI opponent with 4 difficulty levels:

        🟢 Easy – AI plays very poorly (easy to beat)

        🟡 Normal – AI plays decently (medium challenge)

        🔴 Hard – AI tries to block you and win aggressively

        🎲 Random – AI plays completely randomly (can be a genius or a total clown 🤡)

   You take turns with the AI by selecting a board position (1-9).

  The board updates after each move.

   The game automatically checks for:

        A win (3 in a row, column, or diagonal)

        A draw (board full, no winner)
